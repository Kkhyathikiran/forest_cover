# forest_cover
Forest Cover Detection refers to the process of identifying and classifying forested areas on the Earth's surface using various tools and technologies. It involves analyzing geographical, environmental, and satellite data to determine where forests are located, their density, type, and health status.
Sure, here's a complete and clean **README.md** for a **Forest Cover Detection** project using Machine Learning:

Forest Cover Type Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **type of forest cover** (e.g., Spruce/Fir, Lodgepole Pine, etc.) based on cartographic and ecological features. It uses classification algorithms to determine forest types from structured environmental data such as elevation, slope, soil type, and more.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify the forest cover type of a particular area using geographical features. This is a classic **multi-class classification problem** and is based on the well-known **Covertype dataset**.

 Dataset
- Rows: 581,012 samples  
- Features:
  - Elevation
  - Aspect
  - Slope
  - Horizontal/Vertical Distance to Hydrology
  - Soil Type (categorical)
  - Wilderness Area (categorical)
  - Cover_Type (target)

Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA & visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for model building & evaluation)  
- XGBoost / Random Forest Classifier  
- Jupyter Notebook

 ML Models Implemented

- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Logistic Regression (baseline)

Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
- Cross-Validation Score

Results

Achieved an accuracy of over **90%** using **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** after hyperparameter tuning. Feature importance analysis was used to understand the contribution of each variable.

Future Improvements

- Add interactive map-based UI with real-time prediction
- Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask
- Use ensemble methods and stacking for performance boost
